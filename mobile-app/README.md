# AI Advocate

AI Advocate is a privacy-first mobile application designed to make complex California legislative bills accessible and understandable for a general audience. With a special focus on the privacy and safety of vulnerable users, the app utilizes anonymous authentication to provide a secure, registration-free experience.

> **Project Status:** The initial feature set is complete and has undergone a full "polishing" phase. The application is stable, refined, and ready for future feature development or security hardening.

## Core Features

-   ‚úÖ **Browse & Search:** View a real-time list of legislative bills and use full-text search to find bills by title or description.
-   ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Summaries:** Read simplified summaries of complex legal documents, broken down into simple, medium, and complex explanations (currently using mock data).
-   ‚úÖ **User Interactions:** React to bills (üëç, üëé, ‚ù§Ô∏è) and see aggregate counts update in real-time for all users.
-   ‚úÖ **Private Bookmarks:** Save bills for later and view them in a dedicated "Saved" tab. Bookmarks are private to each user.
-   ‚úÖ **Anonymous Authentication:** All user actions are tied to a unique, anonymous identity created automatically on first app launch. No sign-up or personal information is required.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

-   **Frontend:** React Native (Expo) with Expo Router for file-based navigation.
-   **Backend:** Supabase handles the entire backend, including:
    -   **Database:** Supabase Postgres for all data storage.
    -   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth for anonymous user sessions.
    -   **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime for live updates on bill reactions.
    -   **Serverless Functions:** A Deno Edge Function for data ingestion.
-   **Styling:** A custom UI component library built with platform-adaptive components.
-   **Linting:** ESLint with Prettier for code quality and consistency.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient)

### 2. Backend Setup

1.  **Set up the Supabase Project:**
    -   Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    -   Navigate to the **SQL Editor** and run the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql` to create the necessary tables, functions, and security policies.
2.  **Get Environment Variables:**
    -   In your Supabase project, go to **Project Settings > API**.
    -   Find your **Project URL** and your **Project API keys** (you will need the `anon` `public` key).
3.  **Configure Local Environment:**
    -   In the `mobile-app/` directory, create a new file named `.env`.
    -   Add your Supabase credentials to this file like so:
        ```
        EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    -   The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository.

### 3. Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repo-folder>/mobile-app
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Metro bundler and provide you with options to open the app in an iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, or on a physical device via the Expo Go app.

## Completed v1 Polish ‚úÖ

The application has been refined with the following improvements:

-   **Interaction Stability:**
    -   Implemented full toggle logic for reactions and bookmarks, allowing users to add and remove their selections.
    -   The UI now correctly reflects the user's current interaction state.
-   **User Experience (UX) Overhaul:**
    -   Replaced all native alerts with non-intrusive toast notifications.
    -   Implemented skeleton loading states for smoother perceived performance.
    -   Designed and integrated custom empty-state components.
-   **Code Hygiene:**
    -   Removed all unused boilerplate components, screens, and assets from the starter template, simplifying the codebase.

## Future Roadmap

The following are potential next steps for the project.

### üîê Security & Hardening

-   [ ] **RLS Policy Review:** Perform a comprehensive review of all Row-Level Security policies to ensure data is exposed correctly and securely.
-   [ ] **Input Validation:** Add stricter validation on Edge Function inputs and any data submitted by the client.

### ‚ú® New Feature Ideas

-   [ ] **Push Notifications:** Notify users about status changes for their bookmarked bills.
-   [ ] **Accessibility (A11y) Pass:** Conduct an audit and implement improvements for screen readers (VoiceOver/TalkBack) and other accessibility features to better serve all users.
-   [ ] **Bill Details Enhancement:** Add more metadata to the bill details screen, such as author, status history, and links to official documents.
